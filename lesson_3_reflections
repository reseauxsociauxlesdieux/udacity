When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work with a team!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

To save memory space. Since Git changes are in the cloud, it is unlikely that they will crash. Thus, pulling
them all the time would take up unnecessary memory space
